ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY

[ USER SEARCH ]

When you specify a user by their First and Last name, but don't specify the user's context, this script will search for users with the First and Last names specified. If only one user is found with that First and Last name, then that user is modified. 

If there are two users with the same First and Last name, then the script will list both users and will not proceed. 

[DEFAULT CONTEXT]

The "Default Context" can be specified in a configuration file called "settings.cfg". The Default Context setting in the settings.cfg file looks like this: 

AD_USER_CONTEXT=OU=DEMOUSERS,OU=DEMO,DC=cimitrademo,DC=com

[EXCLUDE GROUP]

Users defined in a group designated as the "Exclude Group" cannot be modified by this script. The "Exclude Group" can be specified in a configuration file called "settings.cfg". The Exclude Group setting in the settings.cfg file looks like this: 

AD_EXCLUDE_GROUP=35eddbe6-234f-4f94-af4c-efb0198e4247

DEPENDENCIES

The cimitra_ad_exchange.ps1 script has a dependency upon two other scripts: 

config_reader.ps1
SearchForUser.ps1

These scripts should be located in the same directory as the cimitra_ad_exchange.ps1 script. 

EXCHANGE ACCOUNT CREATION AND CHANGES

In order to create an Exchange Session this script requires several different inputs. For example, an encrypted password file is required. Or the Exchange domain URI. Here are examples for the required switches in order to create a user in Exchange: 

-AddToExchange -ExchangeSecurePasswordFileIn "C:\Cimitra\Scripts\CimAgentPwd.txt"  -ExchangeConnectionURIIn "http://ACME-EXCH16.acme.internal/PowerShell/" -ExchangeDomainNameIn "acme.biz" -CimitraAgentLogonAccountIn "CimitraAgent@acme.biz" -FirstName "John" -LastName "Doe" -ContextIn "OU=ADMINISTRATION,OU=DEMOUSERS,DC=cimitrademo,DC=com"
